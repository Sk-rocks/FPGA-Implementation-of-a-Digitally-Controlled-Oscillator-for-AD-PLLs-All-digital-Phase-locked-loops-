# FPGA-Implementation-of-a-Digitally-Controlled-Oscillator-for-AD-PLLs-All-digital-Phase-locked-loops-

This project focuses on designing and implementing a ring-type DCO on an FPGA using Verilog HDL, with tuneable coarse and fine frequency control. The design is adapted for synthesis using a 45nm technology model and is tested on a Basys3 FPGA board, demonstrating both functional correctness and practical feasibility of digital delay control in hardware.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7684d8b-48a7-4995-95e1-aa5e92a27146)
